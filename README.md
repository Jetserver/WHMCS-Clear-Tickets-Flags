# WHMCS-Clear-Tickets-Flags

This hook simply clears the associated flagged admin when the ticket is closed.

The need for this hook came up when we started flagging tickets for a while, and wanted to search information in other old closed tickets. This is when all the flagged tickets came up first ! (which was disturbing in our point of view)

# Installation

Upload the hook file to your WHMCS hooks folder (“includes/hooks”).
